## Executive Summary

- **Ramp-Up of Demand**: Sales have consistently grown over the past five years, with regular peaks toward year-end and dips mid-year.
- **Forecasting Methodology**: Two models were tested—Prophet and ARIMA. Prophet delivered more accurate forecasts (population-level error of ~6.4% vs. ~10.2% with ARIMA).
- **Forecast Outlook**: Next quarter is projected to have monthly demand in the low-to-mid 14,000s, with a typical variation of ±6% and potential +10% upside.
- **Business Implications**:
  - **Inventory**: Align procurement with forecasted demand and cushion stock for expected peaks.
  - **Marketing**: Intensify campaigns before peak months and run promotions during slower periods to smooth revenue.
  - **Operations**: Coordinate staffing and logistics to meet monthly demand patterns efficiently.
  - **Finance**: Use more reliable forecasts to set revenue targets and budgets.
  - **Scenario Planning**: Be ready for a ~10% demand surge with flexible plans.
